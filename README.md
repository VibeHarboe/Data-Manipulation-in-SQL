# Data-Manipulation-in-SQL
Documenting and applying advanced SQL techniques for filtering, transforming, aggregating, summary stats and reporting on data using CASE, subqueries, window functions, and table reshaping tools like ROLLUP, CUBE, and pivoting.

# 🧪 Data Manipulation in SQL

Advanced SQL techniques for transforming and filtering data: WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, CASE, aggregates, subqueries, and derived columns.

## 🎯 Project Description
This project is based on the DataCamp course Data Manipulation in SQL and expands it with structured, business-oriented documentation and reproducible examples. It showcases advanced data analysis techniques using PostgreSQL.

## 🛠️ Key Skills Acquired
- Filtering & conditional logic: `WHERE`, `CASE`, boolean conditions
- Sorting and limiting with `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- Aggregation & grouping: `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ROLLUP`, `CUBE`
- Window functions: `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `ROWS BETWEEN`
- Subqueries: scalar, correlated, nested
- CTEs vs. subqueries: modular query design
- Pivots with `CROSSTAB`
- Set operations: `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`
- SQL reporting design & storytelling with layered metrics
- Data validation and analysis with nested queries

## 📁 Folder Overview
- `sql/` → Themed SQL files (e.g., case statements, window functions, joins)
- `data/` → Datasets used for query building (.csv)
- `docs/` → Markdown explanations of key SQL concepts and techniques
- `visuals/` → Optional screenshots or query results for reference
- `certificate/` → Certificate resources and links to the DataCamp statements of accomplishment
