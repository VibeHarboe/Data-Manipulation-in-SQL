# Data-Manipulation-in-SQL
Documenting and applying advanced SQL techniques for filtering, transforming, aggregating, and reporting on data using CASE, subqueries, window functions, and table reshaping tools like ROLLUP, CUBE, and pivoting.

# 🧪 Data Manipulation in SQL

Advanced SQL techniques for transforming and filtering data: WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, CASE, aggregates, subqueries, and derived columns.

## 🎯 Project Description
This project is based on the DataCamp course Data Manipulation in SQL and expands it with structured, business-oriented documentation and reproducible examples. It showcases advanced data analysis techniques using PostgreSQL.

## 🛠️ Key Skills Acquired
- Filtering & conditional logic: `WHERE`, `CASE`, boolean conditions
- Sorting and limiting with `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- Aggregation & grouping: `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ROLLUP`, `CUBE`
- Window functions: `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `ROWS BETWEEN`
- Subqueries: scalar, correlated, nested
- CTEs vs. subqueries: modular query design
- Pivots with `CROSSTAB`
- Set operations: `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`
- SQL reporting design & storytelling with layered metrics
- Data validation and analysis with nested queries

## 📁 Folder Overview

- `data/` → Datasets used for query building (.csv)
- `docs/` → Markdown explanations of key SQL concepts and techniques
- `visuals/` → Optional screenshots or query results for reference
- `certificate.pdf` → DataCamp course certificate of completion
