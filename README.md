# 🧪 Data Manipulation in SQL

Advanced SQL techniques for transforming and filtering data: WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, CASE, aggregates, subqueries, and derived columns.

## 🎯 Project Description
This project documents my work in the DataCamp course *Data Manipulation in SQL*. The course covers core SQL operations for data transformation, including filtering, sorting, grouping, conditional logic, and subqueries.

## 🛠️ Key Skills Acquired
- Filtering with `WHERE` and logical operators
- Sorting and limiting with `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- Conditional logic with `CASE WHEN`
- Aggregation with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- Subqueries and derived columns
- Data validation and analysis with nested queries
