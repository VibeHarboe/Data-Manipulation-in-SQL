# Reporting Strategies in SQL

Effective reporting in SQL requires not only knowing which metrics to query, but also how to structure, filter, and summarize your data in ways that match stakeholder needs and business questions.

This guide provides practical strategies for building clear, scalable reports using SQL â€” from simple rollups to multi-dimensional analyses.

## ðŸŽ¯ Common Reporting Goals

| Goal                       | SQL Strategy                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| KPI tracking               | Aggregates + filters               |
| Performance breakdowns     | `GROUP BY` + `ROLLUP` or `CUBE`    |
| Comparison across segments | `PARTITION BY`, `CASE`, or pivots  |
| Trend or growth monitoring | Time-based grouping + window funcs |
| Funnel or conversion flows | Multi-join logic + step conditions |

## ðŸ§± Strategy 1: Grouped Aggregates

Use `GROUP BY` to track performance across key segments:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS hires
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY department;
```

Use `ROLLUP()` to add subtotals:

```sql
GROUP BY ROLLUP(department)
```

---

## ðŸªœ Strategy 2: Funnel Reporting with Conditions

Track user flow through funnel steps with conditional logic:

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  MAX(CASE WHEN step = 'signup' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS did_signup,
  MAX(CASE WHEN step = 'checkout' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS did_checkout
FROM user_steps
GROUP BY user_id;
```

Add conversion logic using `HAVING` or `WHERE` on calculated columns.

## ðŸ§  Strategy 3: Layered Metrics with CTEs

CTEs make reporting pipelines modular and readable:

```sql
WITH clicks AS (
  SELECT campaign_id, COUNT(*) AS click_count
  FROM click_log
  WHERE event_type = 'click'
  GROUP BY campaign_id
),
conversions AS (
  SELECT campaign_id, COUNT(*) AS conv_count
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY campaign_id
)
SELECT c.campaign_id, click_count, conv_count,
       ROUND(100.0 * conv_count / click_count, 2) AS conversion_rate
FROM clicks c
JOIN conversions conv ON c.campaign_id = conv.campaign_id;
```

---

## ðŸ§® Strategy 4: Time-Based Reporting

Aggregate data over time for trend analysis:

```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) AS month, COUNT(*) AS signups
FROM users
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

Use `ROWS BETWEEN` to build moving averages:

```sql
AVG(signups) OVER (ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
```

---

## ðŸ”€ Strategy 5: Pivoted Reports for Readability

Transform rows into columns for easier presentation:

```sql
SELECT * FROM CROSSTAB($$
  SELECT region, year, total_sales
  FROM sales_summary
  ORDER BY region, year
$$) AS ct (
  region TEXT,
  "2021" INT,
  "2022" INT,
  "2023" INT
);
```

Use this format in dashboards, Excel exports, or PDF reports.

## âœ… Best Practices for Reporting Queries

* Use `COALESCE()` to handle `NULL` values in subtotals
* Add `LIMIT` when previewing reports
* Always label derived columns with clear `AS` aliases
* Validate aggregates with a small test group before scaling
* Comment complex logic to aid stakeholder review

---

Well-structured SQL reports bridge the gap between raw data and business insight.
Use CTEs, aggregations, filters, and formatting techniques to make your queries readable, reusable, and presentation-ready.
