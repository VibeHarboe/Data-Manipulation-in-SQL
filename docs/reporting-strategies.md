# Reporting Strategies in SQL

Effective reporting in SQL requires not only knowing which metrics to query, but also how to structure, filter, and summarize your data in ways that match stakeholder needs and business questions.

This guide provides practical strategies for building clear, scalable reports using SQL ‚Äî from simple rollups to multi-dimensional analyses.

## üéØ Common Reporting Goals

| Goal                       | SQL Strategy                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| KPI tracking               | Aggregates + filters               |
| Performance breakdowns     | `GROUP BY` + `ROLLUP` or `CUBE`    |
| Comparison across segments | `PARTITION BY`, `CASE`, or pivots  |
| Trend or growth monitoring | Time-based grouping + window funcs |
| Funnel or conversion flows | Multi-join logic + step conditions |

---

## üß± Strategy 1: Grouped Aggregates

Use `GROUP BY` to track performance across key segments:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS hires
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY department;
```

Use `ROLLUP()` to add subtotals:

```sql
GROUP BY ROLLUP(department)
```

---

## ü™ú Strategy 2: Funnel Reporting with Conditions

Track user flow through funnel steps with conditional logic:

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  MAX(CASE WHEN step = 'signup' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS did_signup,
  MAX(CASE WHEN step = 'checkout' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS did_checkout
FROM user_steps
GROUP BY user_id;
```

Add conversion logic using `HAVING` or `WHERE` on calculated columns.

---

## üß† Strategy 3: Layered Metrics with CTEs

CTEs make reporting pipelines modular and readable:

```sql
WITH clicks AS (
  SELECT campaign_id, COUNT(*) AS click_count
  FROM click_log
  WHERE event_type = 'click'
  GROUP BY campaign_id
),
conversions AS (
  SELECT campaign_id, COUNT(*) AS conv_count
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY campaign_id
)
SELECT c.campaign_id, click_count, conv_count,
       ROUND(100.0 * conv_count / click_count, 2) AS conversion_rate
FROM clicks c
JOIN conversions conv ON c.campaign_id = conv.campaign_id;
```

---

## üßÆ Strategy 4: Time-Based Reporting

Aggregate data over time for trend analysis:

```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) AS month, COUNT(*) AS signups
FROM users
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

Use `ROWS BETWEEN` to build moving averages:

```sql
AVG(signups) OVER (ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
```

---

## üîÄ Strategy 5: Pivoted Reports for Readability

Transform rows into columns for easier presentation:

```sql
SELECT * FROM CROSSTAB($$
  SELECT region, year, total_sales
  FROM sales_summary
  ORDER BY region, year
$$) AS ct (
  region TEXT,
  "2021" INT,
  "2022" INT,
  "2023" INT
);
```

Use this format in dashboards, Excel exports, or PDF reports.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Reporting Queries

* Use `COALESCE()` to handle `NULL` values in subtotals
* Add `LIMIT` when previewing reports
* Always label derived columns with clear `AS` aliases
* Validate aggregates with a small test group before scaling
* Comment complex logic to aid stakeholder review

---

Well-structured SQL reports bridge the gap between raw data and business insight.
Use CTEs, aggregations, filters, and formatting techniques to make your queries readable, reusable, and presentation-ready.

---

## üß© Modular Thinking: Build in Layers

Split queries into logical steps using CTEs (`WITH` clauses):

* Isolate filtering
* Apply grouping/aggregation
* Add window logic or formatting

```sql
WITH base AS (
  SELECT * FROM sales WHERE year = 2023
), grouped AS (
  SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales FROM base GROUP BY region
)
SELECT *, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY total_sales DESC) AS rank FROM grouped;
```

‚úÖ Improves readability & reusability.

---

## üìä Use Window Functions for Trends & Rankings

Window functions allow you to:

* Compare values across rows (e.g. rankings, deltas)
* Calculate running totals, moving averages
* Identify first/last records in each group

```sql
SELECT 
  region, 
  sales_month, 
  SUM(amount) OVER(PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sales_month) AS running_total
FROM monthly_sales;
```

‚úÖ Enables trend tracking inside one query block.

---

## üßÆ ROLLUP & CUBE for Subtotals and Summary Rows

For reports that require roll-up views (e.g. region + global totals):

```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales) AS total
FROM sales
GROUP BY ROLLUP(region, product);
```

‚úÖ Adds subtotals for hierarchy levels.

Use `CUBE(region, product)` for all combination groupings.

---

## üîÑ Pivot Results for Readability

Turn rows into columns for easy reading with `CROSSTAB` (PostgreSQL):

```sql
SELECT * FROM CROSSTAB($$
  SELECT region, month, revenue FROM revenue_data
$$) AS ct (
  region TEXT, jan NUMERIC, feb NUMERIC, mar NUMERIC
);
```

‚úÖ Makes time series and comparison easier for end users.

---

## üîç Combine Filters + Metrics for Storytelling

Example: Report showing active users, churned users, and revenue per country:

```sql
WITH base AS (
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE signup_date >= '2023-01-01'
), churned AS (
  SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS churned FROM base WHERE status = 'churned' GROUP BY country
), active AS (
  SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS active FROM base WHERE status = 'active' GROUP BY country
), revenue AS (
  SELECT country, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue FROM base GROUP BY country
)
SELECT 
  a.country, 
  active, 
  churned, 
  total_revenue
FROM active a
LEFT JOIN churned c ON a.country = c.country
LEFT JOIN revenue r ON a.country = r.country;
```

‚úÖ Ties metrics together into a full narrative.

## üß† Tips for Report-Driven SQL Design

* Use **aliases** clearly (e.g. `AS total_customers`)
* Avoid overly nested queries ‚Äî break into CTEs
* Use **window functions** instead of joins where logical
* Pre-aggregate data when possible
* Add **comments** for stakeholder clarity

---

## üèÅ Final Thought

Good reporting SQL isn‚Äôt about clever tricks ‚Äî it‚Äôs about:

* Clean logic
* Structured presentation
* Metrics that answer real questions

Master these strategies to produce SQL that powers decision-making at scale.
