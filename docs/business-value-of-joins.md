## üß† Key Business Scenarios

### 1. üîç Churn Analysis

**Goal:** Understand why users leave

```sql
SELECT u.id, u.signup_date, c.cancel_date, r.reason_text
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN cancellations c ON u.id = c.user_id
LEFT JOIN churn_reasons r ON c.reason_code = r.code
WHERE c.cancel_date IS NOT NULL;
```

**Business Insight:** Identify top reasons for churn, linked to user tenure.

### 2. üìà Campaign Performance

**Goal:** Measure conversion by campaign

```sql
SELECT c.campaign_name, COUNT(o.id) AS orders
FROM campaigns c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.campaign_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.campaign_name;
```

**Business Insight:** Optimize future ad spend by identifying effective campaigns.

### 3. ‚öñÔ∏è Lead Quality Scoring
