CTEs vs. Subqueries

CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and subqueries both allow you to build intermediate result sets, but they differ in readability, reusability, and structure.

üÜö Basic Structure

Subquery

SELECT name
FROM (
  SELECT name, salary FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'Sales'
) AS sales_employees;

CTE

WITH sales_employees AS (
  SELECT name, salary
  FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'Sales'
)
SELECT name
FROM sales_employees;

üß† Key Differences

Feature

CTE

Subquery

Readability

High ‚Äì named blocks

Moderate ‚Äì nested structures

Reusability

Reusable within the query

Not reusable

Modularity

Easy to refactor/extend

Less modular

Recursive support

‚úÖ Yes

‚ùå No

Performance

Similar, but depends on engine

Similar, can vary

‚úÖ When to Use CTEs

When the logic is complex and reused multiple times

When working with recursive structures (e.g., hierarchies)

When you want to separate transformation steps clearly

‚úÖ When to Use Subqueries

For one-off filters or simple nesting

When you don't need to reuse logic

Bonus: CTEs with Window Functions

CTEs pair especially well with window functions for readable and layered analytics:

WITH medal_counts AS (
  SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE year = 2012
  GROUP BY country
)
SELECT *,
  RANK() OVER(ORDER BY medals DESC) AS rank
FROM medal_counts;

This allows clear separation between data preparation and ranking logic.
