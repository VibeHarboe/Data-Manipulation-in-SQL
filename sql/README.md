## ðŸ“„ SQL Files
- [01_case_statement.sql](01_case_statement.sql) â€“ CASE WHEN logic used to label, filter, and aggregate match results across teams, countries, and seasons
- [02_simple_short_subqueries.sql](02_simple_short_subqueries.sql) â€“ Practical subqueries in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses for filtering, aggregation, and league/stage comparisons

## ðŸ“„ SQL Files Overview

* [02_simple_short_subqueries.sql](02_simple_short_subqueries.sql) â€“ Use of SQL CASE WHEN expressions to classify, count, filter, and compare match outcomes across multiple scenarios:

  * Label categorical values dynamically based on logic (e.g., win/loss/tie)
  * Use CASE in SELECT to build readable, user-facing categories
  * Combine CASE with SUM, COUNT, and AVG for conditional aggregation
  * Apply CASE inside WHERE clauses to filter based on outcome logic
  * Analyze specific matchups (e.g., El ClÃ¡sico, Bologna wins, Barcelona performance)
  * Generate cross-season comparisons for match counts and tie percentages by country

* [02_subqueries.sql](02_subqueries.sql) â€“ These examples illustrate real-world SQL logic for performance analytics, league trends, and advanced data slicing using subqueries. Techniques include:

  * Scalar subqueries for conditional filtering
  * List-based subqueries to include/exclude teams
  * Subqueries in FROM for pre-aggregation and structure
  * Subqueries in SELECT for calculated comparisons
  * Multi-layered subqueries to compare stages against season-wide averages
  * Combined clause strategies (SELECT, FROM, WHERE) in one query
