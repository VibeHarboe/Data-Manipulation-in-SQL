# All .sql files organized by concept

[01_case_statement.sql](01_case_statement.sql) – Use of SQL CASE WHEN expressions to classify, count, filter, and compare match outcomes across multiple scenarios:

- Label categorical values dynamically based on logic (e.g., win/loss/tie)
- Use CASE in SELECT to build readable, user-facing categories
- Combine CASE with SUM, COUNT, and AVG for conditional aggregation
- Apply CASE inside WHERE clauses to filter based on outcome logic
- Analyze specific matchups (e.g., El Clásico, Bologna wins, Barcelona performance)
- Generate cross-season comparisons for match counts and tie percentages by country
