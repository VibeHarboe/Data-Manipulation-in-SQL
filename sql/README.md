## 📄 SQL Files Overview

* [01_case_statement.sql](01_case_statement.sql) – Use of SQL CASE WHEN expressions to classify, count, filter, and compare match outcomes across multiple scenarios:

  * Label categorical values dynamically based on logic (e.g., win/loss/tie)
  * Use CASE in SELECT to build readable, user-facing categories
  * Combine CASE with SUM, COUNT, and AVG for conditional aggregation
  * Apply CASE inside WHERE clauses to filter based on outcome logic
  * Analyze specific matchups (e.g., El Clásico, Bologna wins, Barcelona performance)
  * Generate cross-season comparisons for match counts and tie percentages by country
